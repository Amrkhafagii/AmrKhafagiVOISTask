# point num 5/ Using new admin user, add a new location, verify it is added to list/db --> added new user deleted automatically after creating by short time, so I add the location by the admin user. Also, if new added user has permission to edit/add location, the function actually doesn't work(new users cannot edit/add location if they have permission)
# point num 6/ Using new admin user, Update location details and verify the changes are persisted, the situation the same as above so I did it using the admin
# point num8/ requirement isn't completed in the word document
